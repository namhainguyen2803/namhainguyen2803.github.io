Hi! I’m Khai, a third-year Ph.D. candidate at [Department of Statistics and Data Sciences](https://stat.utexas.edu/), [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Nhat Ho](https://nhatptnk8912.github.io/) and Professor 
[Peter Müller](https://www.ma.utexas.edu/component/cobalt/item/15-mathematics/364-mueller-peter?Itemid=1259). I am associated with Institute for Foundations of Machine Learning ([IFML](https://www.ifml.institute/)) and I am a visiting student at [Statistical Information Lab](https://odin.mdacc.tmc.edu/~wwang7/people.html) at [The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center](https://www.mdanderson.org/). I graduated from  [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://soict.hust.edu.vn/) with a Computer Science Bachelor's degree.
Before joining UT Austin, I was an AI Research Resident at [VinAI Research](http://www.vinai.io) under the supervision of [Dr. Hung Bui](https://sites.google.com/site/buihhung/).



**Research:** My research focuses on both fundamental problems and applied problems in probabilistic machine learning, deep learning, and statistics.

***1. Computational Optimal Transport.*** My research makes [Optimal Transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_theory_(mathematics))  scalable in statistical inference (low time complexity, low space complexity, low sample complexity) via the one-dimensional projection approach which is known as sliced optimal transport (sliced Wasserstein distance). My work focuses on three key aspects of sliced Wasserstein: numerical approximation, projecting operator, and slicing distribution.

***2. Efficiency, Scalability, Interpretability, and Trustworthiness of AI.*** My research enhances the performance of 3D vision models, speeds up the training of generative models, adapts prediction models to new unseen domains, explains multimodal transferable representation, and ensures fairness and robustness in learning processes.

[comment]: <> (<b> <i>Slicing distributions.</i></b> The vanilla sliced Wasserstein &#40;SW&#41; distance naively treats all one-dimensional projections the same and independently by using the uniform distribution over projecting directions. To improve and generalize the SW, I propose to search for the best distribution over projecting distributions &#40;or the slicing distribution&#41; which can maximize the expected projected distance. )

[comment]: <> (In particular, a regularized implicit family of distributions is introduced in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.07367.pdf">[ICLR'21]</a> and  explicit families &#40;von Mises-Fisher and Power Spherical&#41; are introduced in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01787.pdf">[ICLR'21]</a>. Moreover, I introduce the usage of)

[comment]: <> (amortized optimization to predict the optimal slicing distribution given two input probability measures in the setting which has various pairs of probability measures in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.13417.pdf">[NeurIPS'22]</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.04791.pdf">[ICML'23]</a>. To enhance further the quality of projecting directions, I break the independence between them by imposing the first order Markov structure in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.03749.pdf">[NeurIPS'23]</a>. )

[comment]: <> (To avoid unstable optimization and model misspecification in designing slicing model, I propose the energy-based slicing distribution  that is parameter-free and has the density proportional to an energy function of the projected one-dimensional Wasserstein distance in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13586.pdf">[NeurIPS'23]</a>. To push forward further the optimization-free direction, I propose the random-path projecting direction in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15889.pdf">[ICML'24]</a>.)

[comment]: <> (<b> <i>Projecting operators.</i></b> The vanilla sliced Wasserstein distance utilizes the Radon Transform as the projecting operator. The Radon Transform simply takes the inner product between the supports of a probability measure)

[comment]: <> (and  a projecting direction as the supports of the one-dimensional projected probability measure. To generalize the projecting operator to tensor spaces, I use the convolution operator to project probability measures over tensors to one-dimension in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.01188.pdf">[NeurIPS'22]</a>. In addition, I connect deep learning &#40;neural networks&#41; techniques to sliced Wasserstein by proposing Overaparameterized Radon Transform and Hierarchical Radon Transform in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.13570.pdf">[ICLR'23]</a>. Recently, I proposed hierarchical hybrid Radon Transform and hierarchical hybrid sliced Wasserstein distance for dealing with heterogeneous joint distributions in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15378.pdf">[Arxiv'24]</a>.)

[comment]: <> (<b> <i>Numerical approximation.</i></b>  The SW distance is usually estimated by Monte Carlo integration due to the intractable expectation with respect to the slicing distribution. To reduce the variance of the Monte Carlo estimator,)

[comment]: <> (I first propose control variates which are based on the closed-form of the Wasserstein-2 distance between two Gaussians in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.00402.pdf">[ICLR'24]</a>. Importantly, the proposed control variates have linear time complexity and space complexity. In addition, I propose to use low-discrepancy sequences on the sphere &#40;Quasi-Monte Carlo&#41; to approximate sliced Wasserstein in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11713.pdf">[ICLR'24]</a>. Moreover, we propose Randomized Quasi-sliced Wasserstein, an unbiased estimation of sliced Wasserstein which are based on randomizing low-discrepancy sequences.)
